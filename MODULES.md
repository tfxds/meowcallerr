# MODULES.md — registry and build order

The spine of the build. Each module is a discrete, human-approved unit with a
**datasheet** under [`datasheets/`](datasheets/) that carries the reference source
verbatim and the Go target. The abstract protocol spec lives in **wacrg** (the
RFC); a datasheet links to the relevant wacrg page. The reference column names the
source to ingest **into the datasheet** — it never appears in the Go code.

Status: `planned` → `scaffolded` → `implemented` → `verified` (KAT passes).
Scope: **1:1 calls only.**

**Build order is dependency-topological:** the table is sorted so that every
module's prerequisites sit above it — building top-to-bottom, a module's deps are
always already built (no forward prereqs). The `Deps` column names those
prerequisites (module names, the stable identifier — refer to modules by name, not
number, since the `#` is just the build position and can shift if the order is
re-sorted). Deps for not-yet-built modules are inferred from the reference and are
confirmed when the module is reached.

First audible milestone: **decoder (#15)** decodes the real
`inbound_capture_frames.json` to PCM matching `e2e_vectors.json`. Everything above
it in the table serves that.

> Re-sorted into dependency order (was a flatter sequence). Notable moves: `pulse`
> now precedes `pitch`/`gains` (which consume it); `postfilter`/`noise` precede
> `synth` (its CELP path runs them); `stun`/`rtp` precede `warp`/`relay`. Built
> modules kept their names; their `#` shifted — historical commit/CHANGELOG entries
> reference the **old** numbers, so cite modules by **name**.

## Reference KAT status (verified 2026-06)

The reference implementation's own test suite was run (`cargo test --features
voip`). Result: the **decoder/receive path, keying, signaling, and transport all
pass** their vectors — including the end-to-end decode milestone. **One test
fails:** the **encoder** pitch estimator (reference `smpl_pitch_enc`,
`pitch_estimator_matches_c_ground_truth`) diverges from the C ground truth by
`max_err ≈ 0.030`. So:

- The decoder-path vectors (the decode pipeline above `decoder`, #01–#15) are
  trustworthy byte/precision targets.
- The encoder pitch estimator (part of **pitch** (#08) / **encoder** (#16)) is a
  **known soft-divergence in the reference itself** — do not treat it as a
  byte-exact target; a faithful port inherits the same ~0.03 gap. Flagged in the
  affected datasheets.

Datasheets are written **one at a time, when we reach the module** — not
bulk-generated ahead. The exemplar [`datasheets/mlow-toc.md`](datasheets/mlow-toc.md)
is the quality bar.
